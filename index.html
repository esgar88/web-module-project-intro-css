				Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength

				First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its
				waterfalls, but <br />
				within its nearly 1,200 square miles, you can find deep valleys, grand
				meadows, ancient <br />
				giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.

				Fire is a natural and essential <br />
				part of Yosemite. We manage fire <br />
				carefully and study how it <br />
				interacts with the park’s <br />
				ecosystems. This blog provides<br />
				updates about fires in Yosemite. <br />
				Check for <span>current fire <br />restrictions.</span>

			We strongly recommend that you make <br />
			reservations for lodging, camping, <br />
			and backpacking. You can pay the <br />
			<span>park entrance fee </span>upon arrival <br />
			(there's no need to pay it in <br />
			advance).
